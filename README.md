# job_task
1. As always we need dependencies, so: npm i
2. I dumped database (mydb.sql), so you need to copy
in your Postgres server:
    a) in psql shell: create database database_name
    b) in CMD: psql -U username_of_postgres db_name < mydb.sql
3. In public directory, there is a module.js.
Need to change the username, database, password to your.

I hope everything is OK.
